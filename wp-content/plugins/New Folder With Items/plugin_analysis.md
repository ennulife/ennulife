## 3. Core Functionalities and Key Classes

### `ennu-life-plugin.php`

This is the main entry point of the plugin. It defines essential constants such as `ENNU_LIFE_VERSION`, `ENNU_LIFE_PLUGIN_FILE`, `ENNU_LIFE_PLUGIN_PATH`, and `ENNU_LIFE_PLUGIN_URL`. It also sets minimum PHP and WordPress version requirements, ensuring compatibility.

### `includes/class-admin.php`

Handles administrative tasks and integrates with WordPress's admin functionalities. It manages AJAX actions for the admin area and custom user profile fields related to assessments. Notably, the admin menu functionality has been commented out, indicating it was removed per user request.

### `includes/class-form-handler.php`

Manages the submission of forms within the plugin. It utilizes both standard WordPress AJAX handlers (`wp_ajax_ennu_form_submit`, `wp_ajax_nopriv_ennu_form_submit`) and a custom endpoint (`/ennu-submit/`) for form submissions. It includes logging for debugging purposes and sets appropriate headers for cross-origin requests.

### `includes/class-template-loader.php`

Responsible for dynamically loading custom page templates based on post metadata (`_ennu_template_key`). It ensures that the correct templates from the plugin's `templates` directory are used for specific ENNU Life pages, overriding default WordPress template loading behavior.

### `includes/class-live-content-manager.php`

This class facilitates the auto-creation and management of plugin-specific pages and content. It defines various page templates (e.g., main landing, ED treatment assessment, hair restoration assessment) with their respective titles, slugs, content (often containing shortcodes), and meta descriptions. It also includes AJAX actions for creating and deleting all content, as well as sample posts.

### `includes/class-woocommerce-integration.php`

Integrates the ENNU Life plugin with WooCommerce. It checks for WooCommerce activation and provides functionalities for creating, resetting, rebuilding, and deleting products via AJAX actions. It defines various product types (e.g., health assessment, ED treatment, hair restoration) with their names, prices, descriptions, and categories.

### `includes/class-email-system.php`

Manages the plugin's email communication. It defines various email templates for different events, such as form submissions, booking confirmations, and assessment results. It hooks into custom actions (`ennu_form_submitted`, `ennu_booking_created`, `ennu_assessment_completed`) to trigger email notifications to both administrators and users.

### `includes/class-database.php`

Provides enhanced database management, primarily for saving assessment data. It stores individual form fields in both user meta and custom post types. It handles the creation of custom posts for each assessment, sanitizes data, and records user IP addresses.

### `includes/class-assessment-shortcodes.php`

Registers and manages all assessment-related shortcodes. It defines configurations for various assessments and ensures proper security, performance, and WordPress standards compliance for rendering assessment forms and content via shortcodes.

### `includes/class-assessment-cpt.php`

Creates and manages Custom Post Types (CPTs) for each assessment type (e.g., hair assessment, ED treatment assessment, weight loss assessment). It defines the structure and fields for each assessment, allowing for organized storage and retrieval of assessment data within WordPress.

### `includes/class-debug-logger.php`

Provides a centralized logging and debugging system for the plugin. It supports different log levels (error, warning, info, debug) and writes log entries to daily files within the WordPress uploads directory, protected by an `.htaccess` file.

### `includes/class-scoring-system.php`

Implements the scoring logic for all five assessment types. It calculates overall and category-specific scores based on user responses and predefined scoring configurations, providing a quantitative measure for each assessment.

## 4. Assets

The `assets` directory contains CSS and JavaScript files:

*   **CSS**: `ennu-main.css` and `ennu-assessment-modern.css` for styling the plugin's interfaces and assessment forms.
*   **JavaScript**: `ennu-main.js` and `ennu-assessment-modern.js` for interactive elements, form handling, and dynamic content on the frontend.

## 5. Templates

The `templates` directory holds various PHP template files used for rendering different parts of the plugin's frontend, including:

*   `assessment-base.php`: Base template for assessments.
*   `assessment-results.php`: Displays general assessment results.
*   `ed-treatment-results.php`: Specific results template for ED treatment assessments.
*   `hair-assessment-results.php`: Specific results template for hair assessment.
*   `main-landing.php`: The main landing page template.
*   `weight-loss-results.php`: Specific results template for weight loss assessments.

## 6. Languages

The `languages` directory contains files for internationalization and localization, including `ennu-life.pot` (Portable Object Template) for translation.

## 7. Current State and Observations

The plugin appears to be a well-structured and modular WordPress plugin. The use of separate classes for different functionalities (admin, forms, templates, content, WooCommerce, email, database, shortcodes, CPTs, logging, scoring) promotes maintainability and scalability.

Key observations:

*   **Modularity**: The plugin is highly modular, with each class handling a specific set of responsibilities.
*   **AJAX Usage**: Extensive use of AJAX for form submissions and content management, indicating a focus on dynamic user experiences.
*   **WooCommerce Integration**: Seamless integration with WooCommerce for product management and e-commerce capabilities.
*   **Custom Post Types**: Utilizes CPTs for structured storage of assessment data.
*   **Templating System**: A custom template loading system allows for flexible and theme-independent rendering of plugin pages.
*   **Logging**: Includes a dedicated debug logger, which is crucial for troubleshooting and monitoring.
*   **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages is included.

Overall, the ENNU Life plugin is a robust and well-engineered solution for a health platform within WordPress.




## Changelog

### Version 22.5

*   **Fixed:** Parse error in `class-assessment-shortcodes.php` on line 2190 by correcting a syntax error and removing duplicated code within the `sanitize_assessment_data` function.
*   **Modified:** Streamlined data saving in `class-assessment-shortcodes.php`. The `save_assessment_data` function now exclusively saves assessment data to user meta. Removed calls to the `wp_ennu_assessments` database table and Custom Post Type (CPT) creation logic from this function.
*   **Improved:** The `sanitize_assessment_data` function was refined to ensure all dynamic fields, including `dob_` and `contact_` fields, are correctly sanitized and captured before being saved to user meta.





### Version 22.6

*   **Fixed:** Parse error: syntax error, unexpected token "private" in `class-assessment-shortcodes.php` on line 2150. This was caused by a missing closing brace for the `handle_assessment_submission` function.
